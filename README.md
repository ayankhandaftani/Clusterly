# 🌐 Clusterly

**Clusterly** is an interactive web application that demonstrates the power of **K-Means Clustering** — built **from scratch (no scikit-learn)** and wrapped in a **Streamlit UI** for a seamless and intuitive user experience.  
It allows users to visualize how unsupervised learning groups data points based on similarity and distance, making it ideal for learning, research, and experimentation.
